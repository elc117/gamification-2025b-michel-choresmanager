This is ChoresManager, a Kotlin Multiplatform project targeting Android, Web and Desktop (JVM).

### Build and Run Android Application

in your IDE’s toolbar or build it directly from the terminal:
- on macOS/Linux
  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:assembleDebug
  ```

### Build and Run Desktop (JVM) Application

  ```shell
  ./gradlew :composeApp:run
  ```
- on Windows
  ```shell
  .\gradlew.bat :composeApp:run
  ```

### Build and Run Web Application

To build and run the development version of the web app, use the run configuration from the run widget

    ./gradlew :composeApp:wasmJsBrowserDevelopmentRun
    ```
  - on Windows
    ```shell
